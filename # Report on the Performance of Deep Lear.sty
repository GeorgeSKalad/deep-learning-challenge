# Report on the Performance of Deep Learning Models for Alphabet Soup

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop deep learning models using TensorFlow and 
Keras to predict the success of charitable organizations based on various input features. The dataset used in this analysis includes 
information about these charitable organizations, such as application type, classification, and other attributes.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

**Target Variable(s):**
- The target variable for all models is "IS_SUCCESSFUL," which indicates whether a charitable organization's 
funding application was successful or not.

**Feature Variable(s):**
- The feature variables include all the remaining columns in the dataset after dropping "EIN" and "NAME."

**Variables Removed:**
- The "EIN" (Employer Identification Number) and "NAME" columns were removed from the input data because they do not provide 
meaningful information for predicting the success of charitable organizations.

### Model 1: nn (Initial Model)

#### Architecture
- Input layer with the number of neurons equal to the number of input features.
- Two hidden layers with 8 and 16 neurons, respectively, using ReLU activation functions.
- An output layer with a single neuron using a sigmoid activation function.

#### Model Performance
- Trained for 100 epochs.
- Evaluation on the test data:
  - Loss: 0.5558
  - Accuracy: 0.7228

**Achievement of Target Model Performance:**
- The initial model (nn) achieved a reasonable accuracy of approximately 72.28%.

### Model 2: nn_model2

#### Architecture
- Input layer with the number of neurons equal to the number of input features.
- Three hidden layers with 7, 14, and 21 neurons, respectively, using a combination of ReLU and sigmoid activation functions.
- An output layer with a single neuron using a sigmoid activation function.

#### Model Performance
- Evaluation on the test data:
  - Loss: 0.5539
  - Accuracy: 0.7268

**Achievement of Target Model Performance:**
- Model 2 (nn_model2) also performed well, achieving an accuracy of approximately 72.68%.

### Model 3: nn_model3

#### Architecture
- Input layer with the number of neurons equal to the number of input features.
- Four hidden layers with 15, 10, 8, and 6 neurons, respectively, using a combination of ReLU and sigmoid activation functions.
- An output layer with a single neuron using a sigmoid activation function.

#### Model Performance
- Evaluation on the test data:
  - Loss: 0.5563
  - Accuracy: 0.7245

**Achievement of Target Model Performance:**
- Model 3 (nn_model3) achieved a similar accuracy of approximately 72.45 % to Model 2, indicating consistent performance.

### Summary 

In summary, all three deep learning models exhibited good performance in predicting the success of charitable organizations. 
The initial model (nn) achieved a reasonable accuracy of approximately 72.28%, 
and both alternative models (nn_model2 and nn_model3) demonstrated similar accuracy levels,
 with nn_model3 achieving an accuracy of approximately 72.55%.(Average)

Recommendations for Further Analysis:
- While the current models have achieved satisfactory accuracy, further hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or ensemble methods 
could potentially enhance predictive performance.
